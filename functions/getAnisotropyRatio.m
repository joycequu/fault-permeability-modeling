function permAniso = getAnisotropyRatio(vcl, zf, clayMine, idHW)
% Get permeability anisotropy [m^2] for smear fault materials. Note that an 
% object fault with fields disp (displacement in meters) and thick 
% (thickness in meters) must be passed as well.
%
% INPUT:
%   fault: usually, an instance of Fault with fields disp and thick.
%   FS:   an instance of FaultedSection.
%   silt (optional): If 0 (default), it is considered that no silt-sized 
%                    particles are present within the clay fraction of any 
%                    of the faulted materials. If 1, we then account for 
%                    the potential presence of silt particles within the 
%                    clay fraction. This leads to much smaller anisotropy 
%                    ratios (i.e. 1-3 instead of the typical 5-15). See 
%                    Daigle & Dugan, WRR (2011) for further details.
%   isUndercompacted (optional): pass 1 for undercompacted shales.
%
% MODELS:
%   Vcl < smear threshold: 1 (Perm_across = Perm_along).
%
%   Vcl >= smear threshold: Function of predominant clay mineral and 
%                           porosity.
%          We use the model of Daigle & Dugan, WRR (2011).
%          (1) Get grain aspect ratio (m) based on dominant clay mineral 
%              and proportion of minerals in Vcl i.e. only clay, or silt 
%              likely).
%          (2) Compute porosity at faulting depth. We use a compaction 
%              curve (Depth to porosity range). By default, we use the 
%              Baldwin-Butler, AAPG Bull. (1985) +-5% limits, which cover 
%              several other curves for "normally compacted argillaceous 
%              sediments". We sample randomly according to a uniform 
%              probability distribution within these limits. In case of 
%              thick shales and/or likely undercompaction due to e.g.
%              overpressure, the Dickinson, AAPG Bull. (1953) curve is 
%              used. In that case, the isUndercompacted argument must be 
%              passed with value 1.
%          (3) Compute theta as a result of compaction and faulting (i.e. 
%              shear strain).
%          (4) Compute permeability anisotropy ratio 
%              (Perm_along / Perm_across) following Eq. (19) in the paper.
%
% OUTPUT:
%  permAniso: Permeability anisotropy of each fault material derived from 
%             each layer in the footwall and hangingwall.
%  for fcn, gamma must be a scalar, poro can be a 1xN array or a scalar. 
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   Compute permeability anisotropy for material derived from each layer, 
%   with silt particles likely within the clay fraction:
%       silt = 1;
%       permAniso = getAnisotropyRatio(myFaultedSection, fault, silt)
