% MODELS:
%       Function of average section clay content (Vcl) and faulting depth 
%       (zf). The model is based on number of along-strike smear segments
%       obtained from excavated faults in the lab and field. The number of
%       along-strike segments is obtained via counting NH (the number of
%       holes) along strike-parallel horizontal lines with L = D. Then, 
%       nSeg equals 2NH, since each hole is defined by continuous smear at
%       each side.
%          (1) Include the effect of zf by modifying the nSeg endpoints 
%              obtained from papers above. 
%          (2) Compute the mode for the triangular distribution that will
%              be used to sample a nSeg value from the range determined by
%              the nSeg endpoints. The mode moves closer to the nSeg_min
%              (less segmented) as clay content increases. This is done to 
%              agree with observations that thicker clay layers generate 
%              more  continuous smears.
%          (3) Sample a value of nSeg consistent with Vcl and zf
%
% OUTPUT:
% nSeg structure with the fields below.
%       type:  distribution type (triangular)
%       param: mode of the triangular distribution 
%       range: nSeg endpoints 
%       fcn:   function to compute n values of nSeg consistent with inputs
%              for each layer.

% EXAMPLE:
%   vcl = [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9];
%   isClayVcl = 0.4;
%   zf = 500;
%   nSeg = getNSeg(vcl, isClayVcl, zf)
%   vals = nSeg.fcn(n samples)
