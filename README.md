This code was developed as a continuation of my UROP supervisor, Dr. Lluis Salo-Salgado's work of the simulation model PREDICT, which computes the distributions of the fault permeability from statistical samples of a set of geological variables.

This project is based on predict (https://github.com/lsalo/predict) by Dr. Lluis Salo-Salgado (https://github.com/lsalo).
