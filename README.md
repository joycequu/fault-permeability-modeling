This code was developed as a continuation of my UROP supervisor, Dr. Lluis Salo-Salgado's work of the simulation model PREDICT, which computes the distributions of the fault permeability from statistical samples of a set of geological variables.

The overall goal of this project is to:
- Perform uncertainty quantification in a geology setting: conduct local and global sensitivity analysis on the effects of lithological properties on fault permeability by coding in MATLAB.
- Build a surrogate model in Python to predict the composition of fault zone materials at cheaper computational costs using small datasets generated from a simulation model as inputs.

This project is based on predict (https://github.com/lsalo/predict) by Dr. Lluis Salo-Salgado (https://github.com/lsalo).
